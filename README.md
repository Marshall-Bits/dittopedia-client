# Dittopedia

Dittopedia is a web app that allows you to search for resources for developers. 
During my career as a teacher and developer, I have found that there are many resources that are very useful for learning and improving. So why not share them with the world?

## Stack
This project is the front end of the Dittopedia project. It is built with Angular 18. 
Why did I choose Angular? I'm specialized in React but I started learning development with Angular a long ago. I wanted to refresh my knowledge and learn the new syntax of Angular 18.

## Features
- Search for resources
- Filter resources by category
