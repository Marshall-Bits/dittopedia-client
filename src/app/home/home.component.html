<b>- About the creator:</b>
<p>
  I am <b>Marcel</b>, a <b>software developer and teacher</b> who loves to share

  found useful during my career.

<b>- Why did I call it Dittopedia?</b>
<p>
  Ditto is a pokemon that can transform into any other pokemon. I use this
  analogy in my classes to represent the idea of how parameters can be passed to
  a function and have different names when we pass arguments to those functions.
